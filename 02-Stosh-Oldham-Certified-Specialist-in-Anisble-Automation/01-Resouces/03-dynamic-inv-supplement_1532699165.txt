This is a supplemental document for the dynamic inventories lecture meant to detail the output Ansible requires for the dynamic inventory argument.

There are two arguments a dynamic inventory must respond to: --list and --host [hostname]

The --list argument must return a JSON-encoded hash or dictionary containing all groups that are part of the inventory.  The groups must include all host and child group information.

{
   "httpd": {
       "hosts": ["httpd1","httpd2"],
       "vars": {
           "httpd_port": 80
       },
       "children": ["cdn"]
   },
   "cdn": {
       "hosts": ["cdn1","cdn2"],
       "vars": {
           "content_dir": "/var/www/content"
       },
       "children":[]
   }

}

The --host [hostname] argument must return either an empty JSON hash or dictionary or a hash or dictionary of variables to make available to templates and playbooks.

{
    "VAR001": "VALUE",
    "VAR002": "VALUE",
}
